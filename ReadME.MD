# <center> Exploratory Data Analysis: Mental Health Surveys (2016-2019) <center><br>
Welcome to the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of mental health surveys conducted between the years 2016 and 2019.<br>
The primary objectives of this analysis are to explore trends in attention to mental health and openness in sharing personal mental health disorders over the specified time period.<br>
## <center> Overview <center>

**Used dataset:**<br>

For this analysis we are using **Mental Health in the Tech Industry** dataset  that can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anth7310/mental-health-in-the-tech-industry).<br>


**Key findings:**<br>

* Survey respondant are predominantly male and living in US, which implies that this dataset may not be the best representation of people worldwide.<br>
* There is sharp decline in amount of people responding over the years, but percentages considering ill people or having ill family members are prity consistant. This is strong indicator that in USA around 40% of population have some kind of mental ilness. <br>
* Considering these facts: respondant count sharp decline while openess small rise and overall ill people modest decline. All these things together may be basis for theory that there was a boom considering mental health avareness, which made people bit more open about their mental health and encouraged them to seek help ( overall ill people percentage drop). But considering the fact that its quite small dataset, nothign can be said definitively.<br>
